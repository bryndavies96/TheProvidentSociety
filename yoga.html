    <p>Ki Moves offer a safe place of self indulgence, exploration & a space for acknowledgement of our true self. In
        the
        studio, we teach yoga to help others take a step back from the bustling realm, to ground down & cherish the
        ground that
        holds us. Our guides love to offer options to add your own 'flavour' to shapes & wiggles throughout creative
        flows but
        then also guide stillness with opportunities to slow things down & pause. Most importantly we offer an
        experience
        enabling clients to infuse in breath, movement & rejuvenation.</p>
